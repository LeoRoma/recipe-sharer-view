# Recipe Sharer View (React)

## Description

Recipe Sharer is a web application that allows a user to post and share one or more recipe/s with other users.

## Instruction

A guest user that is not registered and didn't login to the application can browse a list of recipes, and if clicks on a recipe displays the details of the recipe.

The application gives also the possibility to register and login, once a user is logged in will be redirected to his own space and has access for the different functionalities of the application.

The different functionalities are: a user can create a new recipe, by creating a new recipe is necessary to fill different forms, such as upload an image, equpment, ingredients and steps. Once these forms are filled automatically redirects to the details page of the recipe.

In the user space page, is possible to choose to delete or edit a recipe.

## Future Features Implementation
- I would like to implement an admin tools, where an admin can manage different accounts that are registered to the application.
- Giving the possibilities to other users to comment and like a recipe.
- When a user creates a new account sends an email verification by email to confirm it.
- Adding new element in the edit page. At the moment a user can only edit a recipe but can not add new items.
- Add a dropdown to help the user to select time and amount of an ingredient. At the moment a user can write by hand quantity and time, but I would like to minimise the error during the input. For example when asked amount for an ingredient, the dropdown gives the possibility to select if is in gram/s, piece/s, tablespoon/s, teaspoon/s etc.
